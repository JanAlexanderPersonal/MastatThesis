\begin{partwithabstract}{Problem Introduction \& Motivation}
    The objective of this project is the development of a model for the automated vertebrae instance segmentation of \acrshort{mri} and \acrshort{ct} scans of the lumbar part of the human spine based on point annotated training data.
    
    This part of the book aims to clarify these terms. 
    I start off with some information regarding the human spine and the medical imaging techniques to investigate it.
    Secondly, I define and clarify different machine learning problems and techniques when working with two and three dimensional images.
    This part of the book ends with a discussion of previous work. 
    First the previous work to tackle the problem of instance segmentation of the human spine from medical images.
    Then prevous work in the field of \Gls{weaklysupervisedl} \Gls{machinevision}.
