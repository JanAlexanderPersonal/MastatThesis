\begin{partwithabstract}{Problem Introduction \& Motivation}
    \par{
        The objective of this project is the development of a model for the automated vertebrae instance segmentation of \acrshort{mri} and \acrshort{ct} scans of the lumbar part of the human spine based on point annotated training data.
    }
    \par{
        This part aims to clarify these terms. 
        It starts with some information regarding the human spine and the medical imaging techniques to investigate it.
        Secondly, this part contains definitions and clarification of different machine learning problems and techniques when working with two and three-dimensional images.
        This part of the book ends with a discussion of previous work, both regarding the problem of instance segmentation of the human spine from medical images and previous results in the field of \Gls{weaklysupervisedl} \Gls{machinevision}.
    }
    \par{
        Finally, this part touches upon a possible practical application of automated lumbar vertebrae segmentation.
