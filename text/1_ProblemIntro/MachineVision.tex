\chapter{Machine vision}

\Gls{machinevision} is the branch of \Gls{ai} focussed on image processing.
The machine vision task performed in this work is called instance \Gls{segmentation}.
In this chapter, I explain what this means. 
The task of segmentation is compared to other machine vision tasks.

This work investigates the used of \Gls{weaklysupervisedl} data for training an Instance segmentation model. 
The concept and benefits of \Gls{weaklysupervisedl} machine learning are explained.
