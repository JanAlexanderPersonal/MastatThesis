\section{Artificial Intelligence}
\par{
    The field of \Gls{ai} (AI) is the engineering discipline of the automation of \textit{cognitive} tasks.
    Tasks such as search, control and classification are generally considered to require a level of intelligence. 
    Automation of this type of tasks to allow a machine to perform them is thus \Gls{ai}\footnote{To be precise, it is not the human intelligence that is replicated. It is the \textit{effect} of this intelligence.}.
    A classic PID controller and even a thermostat controller can be viewed as simple but effective forms of AI.
    This engineering discipline has advanced considerably in the past decades, driven by leaps forward in the available hardware and new algorithms and models. 
}
\par{
    First, the availability and reliability of hardware components such as sensors, cameras, digital storage and calculation power have increased exponentially\footnote{ \textit{Moore's law} states that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years. This rate of progress has held more or less for a wide range of digital components in the past decades.}.
    The size and price of these components decreased equally dramatically. }
\par{
    Second, progress has been made in developing algorithms to use this available data and computation power to solve problems and perform tasks.
    This text does not provide a complete overview of all existing machine learning models. 
    This work makes use of \Gls{deepl} models.
    A \Gls{deepl} model is a type of \acrfull{ann} with multiple hidden layers. 
    Deep learning models are behind almost all recent applications of \acrfull{nlp} and \Gls{machinevision}.
}

\subsection{Neural Networks}
\subsubsection{General neural network architecture}

\begin{SCfigure}[][h!]
    \centering
    \input{images/NeuralNetwork_concept.tex}
    \caption{
        Concept of an Artificial (feed-forward) Neural Network. 
        The illustrated network has 4 layers: the input layer, two hidden layers and the output layer.
        The hidden layers first perform a feature extraction transformation on the input data.
        Based on these features, the output layer can generate the model result.
        This simple network illustrates different characteristics of neural networks: 
        First, this concept is flexible.
        Architectures with more than two hidden layers are common. 
        The number of neurons in the hidden layers is another degree of flexibility. 
        Second, a neural network has a high number of parameters. This small network consists of $n\times m + m \times t + t \times k$ weights $w$ and the activation functions in each layer.
        The concept of a \acrfull{cnn} is to reduce the number of weights in specific layers by imposing these to represent a single convolution filter.
        \label{fig:ann}
        }
\end{SCfigure}

\par{
    An \acrshort{ann} is a collection of connected nodes, or \textit{neurons}. 
    These are typically structured in layers, such as in figure \ref{fig:ann}. 
    There is always an \textit{input} layer and an \textit{output} layer. Between these two, one can find the \textit{hidden} layers\footnote{When there is at least one hidden layer, one talks about a deep network. In practice, \acrshort{cnn}s have multiple hidden layers.}.
    To calculate a node value, the incoming node values are weighted by the connection weights and the result of this linear combination is transformed by an activation function\footnote{
        $\vec{x}$ : values of the nodes connected to node $j$\\
        $\vec{w}$ : connection weights\\
        $\sigma(.)$ : activation function (e.g. ReLu, tanh, ...)
    }:
    \begin{eqnarray}
        z_j(\vec{x} | \vec{w}) &=& \frac{\vec{w}^T\vec{x}}{\sum w_k} \\
        y_j(\vec{x} | \vec{w}) &=& \sigma(z_j)
    \end{eqnarray}
}
\par{
    The parameters defining the architecture of the network, such as the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes per layer and the design of possible convolution layers, are called the model \textit{hyperparameters}.
}

\subsubsection{Convolution neural network}

\acrshort{ann} models can be trained to perform numerous different tasks due to the high number of degrees of freedom in the model\footnote{
    An in-depth discussion of neural network theory is outside of the scope of this book.
    This text aims to reiterate critical concepts the reader is assumed to have some prior familiarity with.
    There are several valuable sources available for readers who are not satisfied with the level of detail provided here.
    Books such as \texttt{Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras \& Tensorflow} by Aurélien Géron or \texttt{Deep Learning with PyTorch} by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga and Thomas Viehmann offer valuable insights and explanations.
}.
However, this high number of degrees of freedom also entails problems and risks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The model weights have to be stored in computer memory. 
    This is limited and restricts how deep\footnote{The depth of a network is the number of hidden layers.} the network can be.
    A deeper network can be beneficial because it can extract more high-level \Gls{features} by combining the lower level features in the preceding layers. 
    \item An over-parametrized network is very prone to overfitting on the train set. 
    An overfitted model has not learned the generalizing relationship between the input and the labels but rather the quirks of the specific train set used.
    \item There are some more technical problems, such as \textit{vanishing gradients} that are associated with naively copying the network shown in figure \ref{fig:ann}. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{SCfigure}[][h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{/home/thesis/images/LeNet_architecture.png}
    \caption{
        Illustration of LeNet, a famous \Gls{cnn} architecture.
        Image is taken from the famous paper \texttt{Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition} by Yann LeCun, Léon Battou, Yoshua Bengio and Patrick Haffner. \label{fig:LeNet}
        }
\end{SCfigure}
\par{
    The convolution layer is a proven technique to reduce the problems mentioned above.
    The convolution layer is suitable for data with a grid-like structure, such as images or volumes.
    The structure of the data allows a high level of weight-sharing. 
    Neurons in a convolution layer are not connected to all nodes of the previous layer. Instead, each has a limited receptive field.
    Regardless of the size of the image, a convolution layer with a $5\times 5$ convolution \textit{kernel} only has 25 weights.
}
\par{
    In figure \ref{fig:LeNet} this idea is illustrated. 
    The nodes of the feature maps in stack $C1$ are all constructed based on a small part of the input image.
    Convolution layer $C1$ has different channels. 
    This means that 6 different basic features can be extracted by this layer, e.g. horizontal lines, vertical lines and right or left slanted lines\footnote{
        These filter kernels are trained on the train data by the backpropagation algorithm. The mentioned features can result from this training procedure but will not be imposed by the engineer.
        }.
    By stacking different convolution layers, the network can learn higher-level features by combining the lower-level features.
}
\par{
    Often, a convolution layer is followed by a \textit{pooling} layer. 
    This is a dimension reduction step.
    This layer converts pixel rectangles (e.g. $2\times 2$) to a single-pixel by taking the maximum or sometimes the average of the pixel values.
}



\subsubsection{Training a neural network}
\marginpar{
        \includegraphics[width=5cm]{/home/thesis/images/ppg_verhaert.jpg}
        \captionof{figure}{Illustration of a ppg sensor, typically worn around the wrist. 
        Apart from the heart rate measurement, this signal can be used to estimate the patients blood pressure without much effort from the medical staff or inconvenience for the patient. 
        Image provided by \textit{Verhaert NP\&S}}
        \label{fig:xVertSeg_Age}
    }
\par{
    Constructing a network requires evaluating it, comparing the evaluation output to a known desired output, and taking steps to bring the model output closer to the desired output. 
    The procedure used to fit the weights of a neural network to the 
    A network is fitted to the \textit{train set} by the optimization algorithm, based on the \textbf{loss}.
    The \acrshort{ml} engineer wants to judge the performance of the model based on one or several \textbf{metrics}, calculated on the \textit{train set}, the \textit{cross-validation set} and eventually on the \textit{test set}.
}
\par{
    The evaluation on the test set, separated from the train set on which the model is fitted, is done to provide the best possible estimation of the model performance on unseen data.
    When training a model, the objective is to obtain a model which generalizes well to future problems\footnote{
        Provided these future problems are samples from the same population as the train set.
    }. One wants the model to learn the general relationship between the input data and the output.
    A model which is capable of producing the outputs for the specific set it is trained on but is not capable of doing this for new data is \textit{overtrained}.
    It has learned the specific quirks of the train set rather than the generalizing relationship\footnote{
        It is also possible that the new data is sampled from a different population than the train data.
        In this case, the model might have learned the desired relationship for the original population, but this relationship turns out to be different for the population in practice.
        }.
    To avoid this, or at least identify the problem, the evaluation on the test set is necessary.
}

\subsection{Artificial intelligence for healthcare applications}
\par{
    Various researchers are exploring the opportunities of \Gls{ai} in medical practice.
    This could reduce the burden of repetitive tasks on medical caregivers and support both medical diagnosis and procedures.
}
\par{
    \Gls{ai} applications can support medical professionals by allowing more cost-effective solutions to monitors patient's condition.
    One example is the use of a \acrfull{ppg} signals to estimate a patient's blood pressure.
    Blood pressure is a valuable indicator of the patient's condition for the medical staff.
    Measuring blood pressure is time-consuming and disturbing for the patient. 
    However, the \acrshort{ppg} signal is relatively easy to measure. This only requires a watch-size sensor\footnote{Several commercial sports watches already use a \acrshort{ppg} sensor to measure athletes hear rate.} 
    around the wrist, that can be worn continuously.
    Inferring the blood pressure from such a \acrshort{ppg} signal\cite{Khalid2018} allows the healthcare worker to access valuable information continuously, cheaper and without much inconvenience for the patient.
}
\par{
    Different researchers investigate \Gls{machinevision} applications for medical applications. 
    Research on image classification for medical diagnosis is conducted among others for melanoma (skin cancer) diagnosis on camera (\acrshort{rgb}) images \cite{Vocaturo2019}.
}
\section{Machine vision}
\par{
    \Gls{machinevision} is the branch of \Gls{ai} focussed on image processing.
    The machine vision task performed in this work is called (instance) \Gls{segmentation}.
    This chapter explains what this means. 
    The segmentation task is compared to other machine vision tasks.
}

\subsection{Machine vision tasks \label{sec:machinevisiontasks}}
\par{
    \Gls{machinevision} is a broad discipline. 
    Humans extract information from images almost subconsciously, and we are often not aware of the different tasks we perform on images.
    The objective of this section is to briefly define different machine vision tasks discussed further in this book. 
    Several machine vision tasks consist of \textit{recognizing} objects, animals or humans in an image.
    A model is built for a finite list of \textit{categories} that can be present in an image.
    Depending on the question asked ad inference time, one can distinguish the following tasks, which are also illustrated in figure \ref{fig:machinevisiontasks}.
}
\begin{description}
    \item[Image classification] is the task of determining what object category\footnote{A slightly more advanced task is to be able to distinguish several classes in one image.} is present in the image, e.g. \textit{Is there a sheep in this image?}
    \item[Object counting] is the task of counting how many instances of each category are in the image, e.g. \textit{How many sheep are there in this picture?} 
    \item[Object detection] consists not only of identification of the object. Also, the spatial position is requested, for example, in the form of a bounding box. \textit{Where is the sheep in this picture if a sheep is present?}
    \item[Semantic segmentation] requires a class estimation for each image pixel. Pixels that do not belong to a specific class are called the \textit{background}.
    \item[Instance segmentation] requires not only that the semantic class is determined for each pixel, but also that two individuals of the same class\footnote{For each pixel, the model predicts not only if it belongs to a sheep, but also which of several possible sheep it belongs to.} are distinguished.   
\end{description}
\par{
    The different machine vision tasks above are ranked in order of how informative the model output is.
    It is clear that only saying if a cat is present in an image is less informative than indicating pixel-per-pixel where this cat is in the image.
}
\begin{SCfigure}[][h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{/home/thesis/images/Classification_vs_Segmentation.jpg}
    \caption{Illustration to compare different Machine vision tasks \cite{SemTorch76:online}. 
    Object detection means that the location of several objects is estimated by the model. This is indicated by the \textit{bounding boxes}.
    Segmentation of an image is classifying each pixel in the correct class or assigning it to the \textit{background} class.
    Semantic segmentation makes no difference between different instances of the same semantic class, instance segmentation does.
    \label{fig:machinevisiontasks}}
\end{SCfigure}


\subsection{Data for training machine vision models\label{sec:trainingData}}
\par{
    To perform the tasks discussed in chapter \ref{sec:machinevisiontasks}, one needs to build a suitable model.
    For \Gls{machinevision} tasks\footnote{and many other tasks.}, the current standard approach is \Gls{deepl}.
    The cost to generate, store and communicate images and computation power has dropped in the past decades.
    This evolution allows to train a model  on previously unimaginable quantities of data\footnote{The \textit{ImageNet} database (\url{http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/index}) consists of more than $14.10^6$ images.}.
    This technique allows a model with a high number of degrees of freedom to be trainded without the need for expert-crafted \Gls{features}. 
}
\subsubsection{Weak supervision types\label{sec:weak_supervision}}
\par{
    To build a model to perform the tasks discussed in \ref{sec:machinevisiontasks}, this model needs to be trained.
    This requires a set of \textit{labelled} images.
    Collection of this dataset - and the dataset labels - proves to be a challenge. 
    Training a model with \textit{weak labels} compared to \textit{strong labels} could help to mitigate the labelling cost problem.
}
\par{
    In the classic approach, the supervision type closely resembles the intended model output, the \Gls{groundtruth}.
    To train a model that can classify an image\footnote{Given an image, the model outputs if this picture is a representation of class \textit{cat}, \textit{dog} or another animal or object. }, 
    one has to \textit{train} the model on a set of labelled images where a human indicated the class.
    To train a model to perform image segmentation\footnote{segmentation means that the model classifies each pixel.}, an expert needs to provide a set of images where for each picture, the objects are delineated.  
}
\par{
    The idea behind \Gls{weaklysupervisedl} is to train a model with cheaper annotations that contain less information than the desired model output, 
    making use of the latest information available in the labels without explicit indication.
    Figure \ref{fig:ImageLabelTypes} illustrates several types of image supervision : 
    From left to right on the top row, this shows point supervision and squiggle annotation, common annotation types for weak supervision.
    On the second row, bounding box annotation and complete mask annotation are illustrated.
}

\begin{SCfigure}[][htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{/home/thesis/images/McEver.png}
    \caption{Four different annotation types \cite{McEver2020}: 
    On the top left the picture is point level annotated. The points are inflated for visibility.
    On the top right, squiggle annotation is used.
    The bottom left shows bounding box supervion.
    While the bottom right image is fully annotated.
    An image level label would indicate that there are multiple instances of \textit{person} and \textit{bike} in the image.
    \label{fig:ImageLabelTypes}}
\end{SCfigure}

\par{
    The objective of \Gls{weaklysupervisedl} is to construct a robust model based on \textit{cheap} (incomplete, noisy or imprecise) labels, sometimes described as \textit{indirect supervision}.
    Numerous creative approaches have been conceived.
    Since the provided annotations in \Gls{weaklysupervisedl} are not full labels, these are sometimes described as \textit{hints} instead \cite{ECCV2020}.
    The basic concept of \Gls{weaklysupervisedl} is that there are two sources of information to draw from: The hints and the prior knowledge about the problem (Priors).
    These \textit{Priors} can be any form of prior knowledge about the object to be segmented\footnote{or any other machine vision task.}.
    Priors can be the object size, shape or location, the number of instances, the similarity across images or the similarity with external images.
}
\par{
    Whether an annotation is considered a \textit{weak label} or a \textit{strong label} depends more on the modeller's intention than on the annotation itself. 
    When one aims to construct a model to infer output labels with a higher informative value than the original annotations, these \textit{labels} become \textit{hints}.
    Making a model predict bounding boxes from a dataset annotated with bounding boxes means considering these as \textit{strong labels}. 
    If one uses the same dataset to construct a model that predicts pixel-wise masks, the labels are \textit{weak labels} or \textit{hints}.
}
For a segmentation task, weak labels can be:
\begin{description}
    \item[Image level labels]: In this case, only the object's class in the image is provided. 
    This would be a full label for a classification task, but it is a weak label for a segmentation task\footnote{Image with image-level annotation can, for some problems, be obtained in large numbers by web-scraping.}.
    \item[Point annotation]: This annotation technique, the subject of this work, consists of asking the expert to indicate the classes with one or several points. This technique is used in \cite{Laradji2020, Laradji2018, McEver2020}.
    In \cite{Maninis2018}, instead of \textit{random} point annotation, the author makes use of \textit{extreme} point annotation. This work chooses to investigate random point annotation.
    This is believed to approximate the fastest and most natural action of simply pointing at an object best.
    \item[Squiggles]: This annotation technique is related to the point annotation technique. Instead of points, the expert is asked to indicate the classes with a squiggly line.
    \item[Bounding boxes]: A bounding box (a rectangle circumscribing the object) is a less precise form of object localization than pixel-wise segmentation.
    \item[Image description]: This task combines the problem of \acrlong{nlp} with the problem of image segmentation. The annotation of the image is derived from a verbal or written description of the image. 
    This annotation type has not yet been used by many researchers. 
    It might be promising since large bodies of datasets could be available from, for example, medical files where a medical expert has provided a written diagnosis based on available medical images. 
\end{description}
\par{
    There seem to be endless variations possible to conceive weak labels. 
    For example, instead of image-level labels, in \cite{Laradji2018}, the number of instances of the specific class\footnote{Which happens to be penguins.} is provided. 
}
\par{
    Bearman et al.\cite{Bearman2015} compare the annotation time required for images from the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.
    The authors report an average time per image of 239.7 seconds per image for full image pixel annotation, 20.0 seconds per image for image-level labels and 22.1 seconds per image for point annotation.
    As is repeated in \ref{sec:PreviousWork_weaklySupervised}, point level annotation is attractive since it barely requires more of the expert's time while delivering more precise information.
    The point label contains valuable localization information, absent from the image level annotation.
    Besides this, the reported cost for labelling additional instances of the same class is only 0.9s per addition instance.
    The image labelling time consists of a \textit{startup cost} of 18,5s followed by the time to annotate the first instance of the first labelled class of 2.4s.
    This means that the time to label the 2,8 class instances that are on average present in an image from the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset takes 23,3 s per image.
    The observation that labelling additional instances of a class results in such a low increase in labelling time is used in this work.
    In chapter \ref{sec:combination} on page \pageref{sec:combination}, the time to provide multiple labels for the \textit{same} class instance will be estimated based on the same addition of 0,9 s.
}
\\[5pt]
\par{
    Techniques to train models on weakly supervised data are more computationally intensive than those on fully \Gls{supervisedl} data.
    The loss function consists of multiple parts and might involve repeated evaluation of the model on the same batch. 
    A two-step process is sometimes used where a first model generates pseudo masks to train a second model on this pseudo mask as if it were a fully supervised task.
    Weakly supervised learning is based on the idea that the cost of human experts is fixed or even increasing while the cost of computation power is decreasing.
    Besides this, the ability to label more data at the same labelling price point can increase the variability of the data on which the model is trained. 
    This can increase the robustness of the model.
