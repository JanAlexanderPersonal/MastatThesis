\begin{partwithabstract}{Conclusions}
    This part of the document summarizes the most important conclusions from this work and possible ideas as a way forward after this work.
    The part starts with an evaluation and discussion of the labelling cost necessary to make the final model. 
    Finally, the lessons learned from this project are laid out and some ideas for further development of weakly supervised models for medical applications are presented.
