\subsection{PLoS Dataset}

The \textit{PLoS} dataset was compiled for \cite{chu2015} in 2015 by dr. C. Chu, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland and made publically available \footnote{See : \url{ http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22304 }} .
It consists of 23 T2-weighted spine \acrshort{mri} scans. 

\subsubsection{Original Objective of the Dataset}

In \cite{Chu2015} the development of a random forest regression approach for spine vertebrae segmenation and classificiation is described.
The results of several random forest regressors and classifiers is unified with a voting mechanism.
This approach obtains a mean Dice metric score of 88.7\%.

\subsubsection{Patient statistics}

Due to the anomimization process, the \textit{PLoS} dataset does not contain patient information.
