\subsection{xVertSeg}

The xVertSeg \cite{Ibragimov2012, xxx} was kindly made available by prof. T. Vrtovec (University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Slovenia), see appendix \ref{seg:datasetagreement} for the agreement.
This dataset contains 25 \acrfull{ct} scans of the lumbar spine, of which 15 \acrshort{ct} scans are fully labeled.
Given the provided data, I can assume these 15 scans were collected from 15 different patients.

For each of these 15 scans, full instance segmenation masks for all 5 lumbar vertebrae are provided. The delineation was performed by a skilled professional.

Additionally, for each vertebra a fracture class and fracture grade is provided. 
Apart from vertebrae classified as \textit{normal}, the dataset contains \textit{mild}, \textit{moderate} and \textit{severe} cases of vertebrae fracture types \textit{wedge}, \textit{crush} and \textit{biconcavity}.

\subsubsection{Original Objective of the Dataset}

The objective of the \textit{xVertSeg challenge}\footnote{see \url{http://lit.fe.uni-lj.si/xVertSeg/database.php}} (2015) was organized by the University of Ljubljana.
Based on the 15 provided scans with corresponding masks, the participans were required to construct a model to make predictions on the test set of 10 unlabelled scans.

The challenge consisted of two tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Segmentation of the lumbar vertebrae. For each scan in the test set, the segmentation masks of the lumbar vertebrae were requested.
    \item Fracture classification on the segmented vertebrae, consisting of morphological grade and fracture classification.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Patient statistics}

The patients in the xVertSeg dataset train set consist of 8 females and 7 males.
The age of these patients is slightly higher than for the other datasets.
The average patient in this dataset is 71 years old.
A box plot of the age distribution between genders is shown in figure \ref{fig:xVertSeg_Age}.

        Most of these pathologies are identified as \textit{mild}.
        This table counts the spine pathologies and normal vertebrae observed over all 15 patients in the xVertSeg dataset.}   
\end{SCtable}

\subsubsection{Technical information}

The xVertSeg dataset contains 15 \acrshort{ct} annotated scans. 
This dataset is very interesting due to the high quality and resolution of the images.
On figure \ref{fig:xVertSeg_image002}, two slices of the same patient (002) are represented.
The slices show the complete, uncropped sections of the torso and abdominal region of the patient. 
There is no \acrshort{roi} cropping.
The distribution of the scan dimensions is shown in figure \ref{fig:xVertSeg_Dims}.

\end{SCfigure}

The scans also have a high base resolutions: in the transverse plane, the grid spacing is lower than 1mm square. 
On the Craniocaudal axis, the slice spacing is between 1.7025 mm and 1.0408 mm.
Mind that during pre-processing the scans are resampled on a $1mm \times 1mm \times 1mm$ grid.
