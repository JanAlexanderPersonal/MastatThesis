\chapter{Modelling methods \& evaluation protocols}
\par{
    This chapter introduces the high-level model concept of this work.
    This consists of the producing a set of pseudo masks from the combination of three weakly supervised models trained on different sets of slices obtained from the same volume.
}
\par{
    Next, the construction, training and evaluation of these weakly supervised models is covered in more detail.
    Attention is given to the model loss function, including two loss components which this work adds to the consistency loss framework.
    Finally, the model evaluation metrics are described.
