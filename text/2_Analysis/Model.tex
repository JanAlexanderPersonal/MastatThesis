\chapter{Modelling methods \& evaluation protocols}
\par{
    This chapter introduces the high-level model concept of this work.
    This consists of producing a set of pseudo masks from three weakly supervised models trained on different sets of slices obtained from the same volume.
}
\par{
    Next, the construction, training and evaluation of these weakly supervised models are covered in more detail.
    Attention is given to the model loss function, including two loss components that add to the consistency loss framework.
    Finally, the model evaluation metrics are described.
