\section{Weakly supervised model}

The weakly supervised model is based on \gls{wise}, introduced in \cite{Laradji2020}.
This network consists of a Localization branch, based on \gls{lc-fcn} and an Embedding branch.

\subsection{Model}

Model is based on \gls{wise}.

The Localization network \gls{lc-fcn} is a \acrfull{fcn} trained with a \acrfull{lc}.
this \acrshort{lc} constists of 4 sublosses: image level loss, point level loss, split level loss, split level loss.d

\subsection{Data}

2D model -> volumes are sliced.
