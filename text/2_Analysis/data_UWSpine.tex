\subsection{UWSpine dataset}
 
This dataset is made available by the Department of Radiology of the University of Washington\footnote{Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License, dataset available at \url{
      https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/data/spine/  
    }}.
It has been constructed by dr. Glocker and team \cite{Glocker2012,Glocker2013} (Microsoft research) in 2012.
For each scan, manual annotations of vertebrae centroids are provided.

This dataset contains 242 \acrshort{ct} scans of 150 different patients.
This grouped nature of the data will be taken into account when performing the split in a train set, a validation set and a test set to avoid information leakage.

\subsubsection{Original Objective of the Dataset}

In \cite{Glocker2012,Glocker2013} the development of a model based on regression forests and a \acrfull{hmm} for vertebra localisation without needing strong assumptions on what part of the spine is visible.

\subsubsection{Patient statistics}

    }

Figure \ref{fig:UW_ageboxplot} illustrated that the patients in the \textit{UWSpine} dataset are relatively varied in age.
Of most patients in the dataset, multiple scan images are available.
The highest number of scans taken from a single patient is 5.

\subsubsection{Technical information}

Only point annotations are available for the \textit{UWSpine} dataset. 
This means this dataset can only be used for weakly supervised model training.

The scans in the \textit{UWSpine} dataset are strongly cropped around the spine, both in the left-right direction and the anteroposterior direction.
