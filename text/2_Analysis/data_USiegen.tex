\subsection{UniSiegen}

This dataset is made available in 2014 by the University of Siegen, Germany.
It was constructed by dr. D. Zukic \cite{Zukic2014} as part of his PhD project.

    }

This dataset contains 26 \acrshort{mri} scans of 17 different patients. 
The fact that scans of the same patient are correlated will be taken into account 

\subsubsection{Original Objective of the Dataset}

This dataset was collected from several hospitals (Sarajevo, Marburg, Brisbane, Schwabach, Bad Wildungen \& Prague). The MRI scanner settings were varied between the scans (T1, T2, TIRM).
The PhD project objective was to build a segmentation model to automate the segmentation of the lumbar vertebrae in the \acrshort{mri} scans to facilitate the diagnosis of several spine pathologies 
such as scoliosis, spondylolisthesis \footnote{Spondylolisthesis is the displacement of one spinal vertebra compared to another.} and vertebral fractures.
The final model developed by dr. D. Zukic consisted of a Viola-Jones detector for detection and vertebral body size approximation.
The average Dice score compared to the manual reference was reported to be 79.3\%.

\subsubsection{Patient statistics}

Figure \ref{fig:USiegen_Age} illustrates that the USiegen dataset contains almost double the amount of female patients compared to male patients.
These patients are relatively young compared to the patients in the \textit{xVertSeg} dataset.

The scans were cropped in the \textit{left-right} direction.
