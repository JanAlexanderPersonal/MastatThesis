\begin{partwithabstract}{Results \& Experiments}
    In this part, the results of different experiments are provided, analysed and interpreted.
    First, experiments were conducted on models training on volume slices along one of the three dimensional axis.
    The performance of these models with respect to their Hyperparameters is analysed.
    Second, the results of different single dimension models are combined to obtain a pseudo mask for training the final model.
    Finally, this model is trained on the pseudo masks.
