\chapter{Single dimension model combination\label{sec:combination}}\thispagestyle{empty}

In chapter \ref{sec:singleDimension}, the construction of single dimension models is discussed.
These models extimate the segmentation masks of $352 mm\times 352 mm$ patches of scan volume slices along one of the three main axis.
In this chapter, the results of these single dimension models are combined to form a \textit{pseudo} mask that is subsequently used as labelling to train the final segmentation network.
Details regarding this combination procedure are given on page \pageref{sec:combinationProcedure}.
Interesting to note in this procedure is that the evaluation metric of these obtained segmentation masks is improved in each of these steps.
The pseudo mask volume performs better than the single dimension model results and the final model trained on the pseudo masks performs better than the pseudo mask itself.

\par{
    In table \ref{tab:combination_1}, the segmentation quality is calculated on the validation set.
    Since there are two hyperparameters (the number of denoise iterations and the number of erosion iterations) to optimise in the combination algorithm \ref{alg:combination}, 
    the algorithm is evaluated with a matrix of these hyperparameters to choose the optimal hyperparameter set to construct the pseudo masks for the test set.
    In figure \ref{fig:hyperparameter_combination_1}, this obtimization procedure is illustrated.
    The optimal hyperparameter set in this case was 2 denoise iterations and 1 erosion iteration.

\par{
    The procedure described in the last two chapters now allows to train a network with only point annotated labels by using the results of the pseudo mask volume.
    Mind however that the results in chapter \ref{sec:singleDimension} and the results combined in this chapter were obtained with a different set of point annotations for each dimension.
    This was done to make comparison possible. The next chapter discusses a more realistic scenario.

\chapter{Pseudo mask training}
\par{
    In reality, an expert will generate a single stack of annotations, not three.
    As described in chapter \ref{sec:annotationPoints} on page \pageref{sec:annotationPoints}, one of the single dimensional models will be trained on this stack of annotated slices.
    The other two however, will be trained on stacks where the same annotation points are used, but now as these are found back when slicing in the two other dimensions.
    This means that for the slices along one of the geometric dimensions, a known number of annotation points will be provided.
    For the slices perpendicular to the other two geometric axis, the annotation points will have to be deduced from this original stack.
    Figures \ref{fig:inferepoints_1} and \ref{fig:inferepoints_2} illustrate this.

\par{
    Inferring annotation points from labels provided for slices taken in another direction implies the number of annotation points will vary.
    For some slices, no annotation points will be available.
    As a first test, point annotations in the sagittal slices with 1 class point per class instance and 1 background point were created.
    This showed to decrease the number of labelled strongly. When training with these slices, the segmentation networks showed to perform very poorly
    (inverse weighted dice scores of 0.22, 0.23 and 0.33 for the models trained respectively on the transverse, frontal and sagittal slice stacks).
    As is discussed on page \pageref{sec:trainingData} the cost of additional data points when the first point is provided is very low.
    When generating 3 labels per class instance and 5 background labels, the estimated cost is only increased to about $\frac{22,1 + 6.0,9}{239.7}=11,5\%$ of the cost of a full mask label.
    It is clear that this type of reasoning cannot be stretched to extremes (100 points or such), yet, the numbers of 3 and 5 seem perfectly reasonable.

Table \ref{tab:combination_precalc} illustrates how the performance of the combination of models trained on different slice stacks results in pseudo masks which prove to be an improvement compared to the individual models.
It is remarkable how high the performance of the models trained on \textit{inferred} annotation points proves to be.
Seemingly, randomizing the number of annotation points could have a positive influence on the model performance.

\FloatBarrier

Illustration \ref{fig:fullvsPseudo} shows the final result of the procedure.
With the pseudo masks obtained from combining the three model results, a new model is trained.
This last model is only trained on the sagittal slice stack.
The final results obtained with this model are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:fullvsPseudo}.
The hyperparameters of this model were optimized in the same way as the reference model.
The unweighted cross entropy loss proves to yield better results than the weighted cross entropy loss.
For the reference model, the same result was observed.

The confusion matrix of the model trained with pseudo mask labels (table \ref{tab:pseudo_confusionMatrix}) shows the model performance is clearly inferiour to the model performance of the fully supervised model.
Mind however that this model is trained based on data of which the labelling only costs about 12\% of the labelling cost of the fully supervised model for the train set scans.
The total labelling cost will be higher since the procedure requires full labels for the model evaluation in the cross validation and the test set. 
If one takes, is was done in this thesis, both the cross validation and test set to be $\frac{1}{6}$ of the total volumes, the total cost is about 41 \% of the cost for full labels.
One could also look at it in another way: for fixed cross validation and test set, the train set can be made 8,3$\times$ larger with the same labelled cost.

    Since the final model is exactly the same network as the reference model, only trianed with pseudo masks instead of full masks, the inference time is exactly the same.
Preprocesing of one volume was observed to take 3.9 seconds on average (see appendix \ref{sec:hardware} for details on the hardware used).
After this, evaluation of one volume and recombination of the crops takes, on average, 8,3 seconds.
The segmentation masks illustrated in figure \ref{fig:fullvsPseudo} can both be generated in 12,2 seconds.
}
\par{
    The obtained segmentation masks are too restricted.
    While the position of the vertebrae seems to be predicted correctly, the model does not predict the full extend of the vertebra and many vertebra voxels are classified as background, hence the low recall.
    The ground cause of this phenomenon could not be discovered.
    No post-processing steps (dilation, watershed) to remedy this a-postiori were intended. 
}

\par{
    To investigate the performance difference observed between the different datasets, models were trained using only data from a single data source.
    Due to small differences between the datasets, both in labelling (some dataset include the laminae in the labels while others do not) and the imaging techniques used to obtain the dataset (\acrshort{ct} or \acrshort{mri}),
    one could believe that combining these datasets could cause one to influence the network performance on the other.
    After training these single source models, large differences between the performances of these single source models were observed.
    The latter calls for concluding that there are factors within each dataset determining how well the model can generalize.
