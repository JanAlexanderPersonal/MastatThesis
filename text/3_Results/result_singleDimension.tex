\subsubsection{Weighted vs. unweighted point loss performance}

Contrary to fully supervised models, in the weakly supervised case, the ratio between labelled points is not as unbalanced.
This explains the weighted point loss performance compared to the unweighted point loss performance.

\subsubsection{Value of the added loss components}

The added loss compontents show to deliver some added value.
