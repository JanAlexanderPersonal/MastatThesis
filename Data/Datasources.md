# Log of dataset search

Goal: Datasets of segmented or weakly anotated CT scans of the human spine

## Spineweb datasets

References to these databases are grouped on [SpineWeb website](http://spineweb.digitalimaginggroup.ca/Index.php?n=Main.Datasets).
This website provides references to 16 datasets.
Unfortunately, maintenance of this website seems to be halted.

The individual providers of these datasets were contacted.

### Template for dataset request.

Dear [1st author relevant paper],

I am working on my master thesis project titled Automated segmentation of the human spine on CT
images from point-level labels.
Based on the information available on SpineWeb, I learned you are the maintainer of the dataset referenced in 
[relevant article].
I have requested this dataset from the SpineWeb website, but have been unsuccessful.

Would it be possible for you to share this data set with me?

Thank you in advance,


Regards,


Jan Alexander

### Results on of requests:

#### Dataset 16: 609 spinal anterior-posterior x-ray images

Very interesting dataset with landmark annotation.
Spineweb form completed.
e-mail to Dr Shuo Li (slishuo@gmial.com) with request to share dataset.

#### Dataset 15: Test set for CSI 2014 Vertebra Segmentation Challenge

Dataset seems to have been available on [this website](http://csi-workshop.weebly.com/challenges.html) but has been removed since.
e-mail to Dr Shuo Li (slishuo@gmial.com) with request to share dataset. (same person as dataset 16).

#### Dataset 14: IVDM3Seg â€“ Intervertebral Disc (IVD) Localization and Segmentation from 3D Multi-Modality MR (M3) Images

Email send to Dr. Zheng --> Email: guoyan.zheng@istb.unibe.ch 
Including requisition document.

Part of the IVDM3Seg challenge: [link](https://ivdm3seg.weebly.com/data.html)

Prof Zheng has moved on to a new position. E-mail send.

#### Dataset 13: xVertSeg - Segmentation and Classification of Fractured Vertebrae

it was possible to obtain this dataset from [xVertSeg](http://lit.fe.uni-lj.si/xVertSeg/database.php)

#### Dataset 12: Testing set A of the MICCAI Challenge on Vertebral Fracture Analysis

This dataset seems to be less interesting

#### Dataset 11:

This dataset could be obtained from [uni-siegen website](https://www.cg.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en/spine-segmentation-and-analysis)



#### MICCAI 2016 dataset:

found on [link](http://www.cistib.org/miccai2016_avf/index.php/data).
