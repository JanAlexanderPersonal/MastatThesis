	The poster pre-defence

	In order to be allowed to defend your master thesis, it is necessary to do a poster pre-defense. Each student prepares one slide in the form of a poster (please use at 16:9 format and not an A4 format as this is not ideal for an online presentation) about their master thesis. This is a great moment to get useful feedback on the started work. No final results need to be presented, rather the problem and ideas on how to tackle it. You have 5 minutes (sharp) to present, followed by 5 minutes of questions. Note that the pre-defence is compulsory, but no score is given - see the thesis guidelines on the Ufora InfoSite for more information. 

	If you want to present a poster, please send an email to Jan.DeNeve@UGent.be and MaStat@UGent.be before March 24 with the title of your poster. 

	The online pre-defence will take place on March 31 at 4pm via Bongo (an invitation will follow).
